# My Personal Website #
**NO AI NEEDED!**</br>
I wrote this website to teach myself HTML and CSS, and I will be updating it as a learn more web design skills and create more projects.
I also hosted this site on Vercel at [GhostYT7582.online.](https://www.ghostyt7582.online)
I tried not to use AI, but I did use it to help me with some basic CSS formatting and to help with the readme, as I have never used Markdown before.
This website has 3 pages, an index page, a page with my contact info, and a page containing my projects.</br>
Yes, there is a photo of Eminem. I couldnt find my profile photo so I put him on the website instead.
